<!--We need to make sure"input" is a number, and if not a number, will ask user to supply an actual number. 

Make sure input is not a decimal - num % 1 !=0 Error checking Make sure"num" prints to HTML page, right now it's just alerting.

 Note that if you try to convert something like"this is a string" to an integer with +"this is a string", it will evaluate to NaN. Your app should ensure that the user supplied value does not evaluate to NaN. If it does, you should supply a message telling them they need to supply a number.-->
